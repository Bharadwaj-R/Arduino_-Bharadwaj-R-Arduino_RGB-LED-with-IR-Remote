# Arduino RGB LED with IR Remote
### Controlling an RGB LED with IR Remote, using Arduino Uno

***Overview :***  
Controlling the colour of an LED with an IR remote. Based on the button pressed, the colur of the LED varies among Red, Blue, Green and White.  
- 0 - White
- 1 - Red
- 2 - Blue
- 3 - Green
- Power - Turn off the LED

***Required Components :***  
- Arduino Uno
- 150 ohm resistor
- 4-pin RGB LED
- IR Remote
- IR Receiver Sensor
- Jumper Wires

***Connections :***

***Versions***  
- v1.0.0 - RGB and White colours with different buttons.

***Motivation Behind the Project :***  
A different version of this project is given as a task for me during the inductions process for the IoT club of IIIT Trichy. The question was only to turn on and off the LED, but I thought of modifying the circuit a bit more, and include the 4-pin LED.
